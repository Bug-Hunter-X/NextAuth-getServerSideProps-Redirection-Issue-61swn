# NextAuth getServerSideProps Redirection Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in NextAuth's integration with `getServerSideProps` where redirection to the login page upon unauthenticated access isn't functioning correctly.  The application unexpectedly displays a blank page instead of redirecting.

## Bug Description

The `getServerSideProps` function in the `/pages/about.js` file attempts to redirect an unauthenticated user to the login page. However, instead of redirecting, a blank page is rendered.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the about page: `http://localhost:3000/about`
5. Observe that a blank page appears instead of being redirected to the login page.

## Expected Behavior

The application should redirect unauthenticated users to the login page, as specified in the `getServerSideProps` function.

## Actual Behavior

The application renders a blank page when the user is not authenticated.

## Solution

Refer to `aboutSolution.js` for a solution to this problem. The solution involves correctly configuring the redirect within `getServerSideProps`, handling potential errors, and ensuring proper NextAuth setup.
